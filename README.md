The scripts included in this file are related to a wider initiative in the author's day job, but are created outside his working hours. No information pertaining to commercial projects are included in this repository.

The author would like to thank his collaborators, both inside and beyond his company, for their mutual enthusiasm for automation in geotechnical engineering.
